# Security Policy

Safety is one of the core principles of scorpion, and to that end, we would like to ensure that scorpion has a secure implementation. Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

## Reporting

All security bugs in scorpion related projects should be reported by opening a draft security advisory through the GitHub repository.You will recieve a GHSA-### ticket. We ask that you also send an email to <security@scorpion.io> with the GHSA number attached. This list is delivered to a small security team. Your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and youâ€™ll receive a more detailed response to your email within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. If you would like, you can encrypt your report using our public key. This key is also On MITâ€™s keyserver and reproduced below.

> This email address receives a large amount of spam, so be sure to use a descriptive subject line to avoid having your report be missed. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement. As recommended by RFPolicy, these updates will be sent at least every five days. In reality, this is more likely to be every 24-48 hours.

If you have not received a reply to your email within 48 hours, or have not heard from the security team for the past five days, there are a few steps you can take (in order):

1. Contact the current security coordinator
   - **Brett Wilcox:** <brett@scopion.io> - [public key](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brettwilcox/195560f183d04e329f1b1d8631366a3f/raw/cb3e4b2d2f8a4fdf483d21497cb00ef381597b15/public_key.asc).
2. Post on the internal issue tracker
3. Please note that the issue trackers are public areas. When escalating in these venues, please do not discuss your issue. Simply say that youâ€™re trying to get a hold of someone from the security team.

## Disclosure policy

_The scorpion project has a 5 step disclosure process._

1. The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process.
2. The problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined.
3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
4. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still under maintenance. These fixes are not committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.
5. On the embargo date, the scorpion GitHub Security Advisories is sent a copy of the announcement. The changes are pushed to the public repository and new builds are deployed to scorpion.io. Within 6 hours of the mailing list being notified, a copy of the advisory will be published on the scorpion blog.

This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible, however _itâ€™s important that we follow the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a consistent manner_.
